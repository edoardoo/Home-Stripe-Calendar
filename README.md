# Home Stripe Calendar
A home stripe calendar plugin for SpiderCalendar wordpress plugin.

What's a stripe calendar? I decided it was something like the following picture, if it's not let me know.
Clicking on an event will open the description under the calendar, as shown in the picture. 

**Note**:
This plugin is thought for web developers who knows how to read and write code but don't have time to implement it, no improvised web designers, mhkay? 
You have to change the url inside the `HomeCalendar_Plugin.php` file to make it load the description.
Implementation has been very quick, so didn't have time for settings panels and stuff. Do it like in the old days, hardcode everything.
